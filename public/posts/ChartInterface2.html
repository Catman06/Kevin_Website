			Over the past two days I have worked to add the ability to add new charts to the database from the site and to make the site look like it
			came from the 41st millennium. I have spent far more time making everything work in a visual sense than I needed to make the site function
			correctly. There were a few particular issues with the glitch filter over everything that must be worked around.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementing the ability to add new charts wasn't that hard to set up. Just a modal with a form that has all the requisite inputs/textareas
			for the database's columns and some PHP to insert the data into the database. The only places I ran into difficulty was with getting it
			positioned correctly and keeping the overflow from the textareas hidden. Turns out they had the same root cause...
		</p>
		<p>
			The glitchy filter over the website is really neat and, in my opinion, is a big part of the feel of this new site. There are some serious
			problems with having a filter over almost all elements of a website, however. As I eventually found out, filters create new bounding boxes
			for the content within them. This is fine for their intended purpose of affecting an image or a single element, but starts to cause issues
			when most of your website is bounded by a box that you don't have a way to control.
		</p>
		<p>
			My solution ended up being discovered over the two days and involved a lot of trial and error, testing different ways of positioning elements
			to see which would play nice with the filter. Ultimately I found that if I placed the filter into a div containing the content of the site,
			but not the navbar as that is meant to represent a physical element of the cogitator, that helped. The real challenge was the modal for
			inputting new charts. That needed to be positioned "fixed" so that it could sit in front of everything else, and (I think) because it wasn't
			seeing the window but rather the filter as the top level bounding box, wasn't placed right. Eventually, by using vh and vw, units representing
			1% of the screen height and width respectively, I wrangled it into place.
		</p>
		<p>
			While battling the filter's positioning issues, I did add something else. I added the aforementioned navbar to allow for future expansion in
			what info the site offers. It is styled as a physical panel on the cogitator, rather than an onscreen menu, and as such isn't subject to the
			glitch effect and can use colors other than green. I also placed a small logo of the dynasty's coat of arms on there, which was it's own
			struggle to figure out a good method of making the white strokes of the image transparent despite having stuff below them. Masks, as it turns
			out, work great.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now the only options on the navbar are the chart interface and a homepage that shows a big green version of the Valentine heraldry. I'm
			not sure what, if anything, I will add in the future. I would add the history/lore of the dynasty, but I prefer having that in the Google Doc
			where the players can also edit and add stuff easily. Another thought I had was making use of the database to store info on the star systems
			and planets the players discover, but I don't have a particularly set idea of what info would be required for that. Additionally, that too
			would be nice for the players to be able to easily edit and add to.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't know what my next step with the site is going to be, or if there even will be one. I think the site will work well for its original
			purpose of giving access to the dynasty's charts and it looks good doing it, so I might just leave it as is until a new problem shows up.
