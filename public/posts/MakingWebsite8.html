			I initially wasn't going to really deploy this new website on my server, as it wasn't working. Not the server mind you, but the port forwarding
			to it. I believe the issue was with the Plume Home software used, as when I went to our ISP for support, they temporarily fixed it by rolling back a
			version. However after some time working, the port forwards once again stopped forwarding and I was back to being without a functional web server.
			This wasn't much of an issue, as most of the things I do with the server are over LAN, and are therefore unaffected by an issue with port forwarding.

			Despite it not being my intention, I fixed the problem this morning after trying and failing to SSH into the server. I went to the server physically,
			and found the issue was with getting a connection to the Wi-Fi. I still don't know exactly what the issue was, but I believe it had to do with the
			wrong NIC being used and the MAC address of the server having changed due to that. Either way, I was able to fix the problem by unplugging and replugging
			the USB Wi-Fi dongle. However apparently the server was previously using an old PCIe NIC that I had never removed, so now that the dongle was being used
			the MAC address was different. This ended up being a blessing in disguise, as after setting up port forwards for the new device (Plume Home recognises
			devices by MAC address only it seems) port forwarding seems to have started working again. I don't really know why this worked, I had re-applied the port
			forwarding settings with the old MAC address and it didn't change a thing, but hopefully this fix will stick.

			With my server now fully functional, I decided to host the new website on it. The first step was figuring out what to do with the old one. I don't want to
			fully delete it as I did spend a long time making that old site, and there are things that I don't want to fully lose access to. What I decided to do
			was to move the whole old site into a sub-directory and just change all the links to reflect that. It's not a particularly elegant solution, as it
			requires quite a bit of manual work to keep the whole old site from breaking, but I can fix problems as they arise. As for the new site, the only change
			to the site itself is changing where things are being fetched from to be from zipperserver. To deploy the site, I am using npm. It is already a requirement
			for building Vue and testing via Vite, so it's the natural choice to deploy with. To do this, I just added a new script in the package.json that clears the
			old version then copies the new one from the location that the site builds to.
