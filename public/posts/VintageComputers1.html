			At an estate sale I found an entire IBM Aptiva 2159-S7H setup for just $75 including the CRT monitor, access station (which
			contains the cd drive and floppy drive), keyboard, mouse and tower, though no HDD. Along with the computer I also bought all
			the paperwork and cds that the computer originaly came with, which were fortunately also at the estate sale. I brought it
			home and set it up to find that there were	some issues. This wasn't unexpected, as the computer is ~30 years old, so I was
			ready to get to work fixing it up.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first issue was that the insides of the computer were shockingly dirty, with what appeared to be dirt splatter on several
			components in addition to the expected layer of dust. After cleaning everything, I got to troubleshooting issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			Initially, the computer would POST and report several errors. If I tried to get into the BIOS, after 1 or 2 keystrokes, the
			keyboard would stop working. To get more info on the reported errors I found the service manual online and looked the error
			codes up. They were seemingly quite disparate and not seemingly connected to any one device. I took another look inside the
			computer and started troubleshooting by seeing if removing any component would make things work. I found that removing the
			MWave sound card/modem would make the keyboard consistantly work, though it didn't fix most of the shown by the POST. Despite
			checking every setting in the BIOS, I couldn't solve any of the errors. I thought that the issue might be that the computer
			needed the MWave card installed. While the issues seemed unrelated to it, so did the keyboard issue, and removing the card
			effected that. Working with the idea that there was an issue in the Mwave card, I started looking for a replacement.
		</p>
		<p>
			I found the card I needed on Ebay, and bought it as well as an SD card to IDE converter so I could use an SD card as the
			hard drive. That would be more reliable and far cheaper than trying to use a period appropriate HDD. When the card and
			converter arrived I set up the Aptiva again, however, the new card seemed to cause the same issue as the old one, not
			allowing me to use the keyboard more than a couple of times. However, with an actual drive in the computer, I could now
			start trying to install Windows 95 and the original software it would have come with, just without sound.
		</p>
		<p>
			Installing Windows 95 is something I have done a few times in VirtualBox, so there were no suprises there, however getting
			the special recovery disc to work was quite the challenge. Eventually, through trial and error I figured out how to use the
			recovery disc. Despite it formatting and partitioning the drive, seemingly making it irrelevant what was previously installed,
			the recovery disc needs to be used over an existing Windows 95 install. With the recovery disc installed, I now had a working
			Windows 95 computer, right?
		</p>
		<p>
			No. The install was extremely unstable, constantly blue screening with what I believe were memory errors. Clearly something
			was still very wrong. I tried using the different sound cards again and reseating the memory. Instead of fixing anything,
			the computer ceased working at all, with POST errors relating to all sorts of things. I checked the service manual and looked
			up each error to find if there was any common component. The only part that appeared in all of the errors was the motherboard.
			Surely that's the root issue, right? It explains the wide spread of the errors reported in a way nothing else could easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I went back to Ebay to find a replacement for the motherboard. Fortunately I found one, and ordered it; It even came with
			more memory and a CPU, though a slower one. Once it arrived I swapped everything out and powered it on. And it was glacial.
			I don't know what is wrong with the board, but even if I switch CPUs the POST process takes several minutes and has graphical
			glitches. So that was a bust, and I was back to square 1, with no clue what the issue was.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point I found a section in the service manual that refers to the exact set of errors I was facing. Apparently the real
			issue was with the Access Station or the card that connects it to the motherboard. Great, I now know more confidently what part
			is having issues. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone selling that component. Unlike the MWave card and motherboard, the access
			station is specific to this model of Aptiva, which wasn't super common to begin with. The only option would be to buy a whole
			new Aptiva 2159-S7H and hope that the access station card was the issue and not the access station itself. If the station itself
			was where the issue lied, I was simply out of luck, as I could find none for sale. Seeing as the only option would cost me ~$300
			I gave up on being able to fix the Aptiva and put it back together in it's original configuration.
		</p>
		<p>
			I tried to turn it on one more time and it POSTed without errors. I put an SD card into it and installed Windows 95, then installed
			Windows again via the recovery disc and it all just worked as if there was no issue. Even the sound was working just fine.
			I have no idea what changed, but I have been installing programs and messing around with it for a while now and it's had no more
			issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've run quite a variety of things on the Aptiva now from games such as Doom, Starcraft, Fallout, and MechWarrior 2; Microsoft Office 97 and
			WordPerfect 6.0 for productivity software; Cakewalk Professional 3.01 for MIDI composing; Borland C++ 5.02 to try out C++ development; and
			I even got Vim 6.0 working.
