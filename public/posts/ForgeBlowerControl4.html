			With the new 20W heat sink in place, I have now basically completed the blower controller. I have tested the
			controller in place with the dial clipped to the forge, and it seems to work well. I did set the cycle length
			down to 50ms in order to smooth the pulsing, and that also worked fine.

			The last step will be to find a container to put the circuit into. While I could just leave it as is, there is
			a risk of being stepped on, and some danger of things coming into contact with live wires. To avoid the live
			wire issue I have wrapped any bare wire in electrical tape, so it shouldn't be an issue. As for the box, I'm
			not fully sure what to use; I need to keep the heat sink exposed, while keeping the rest of the circuit inside.
			It will certainly require some cutting for the in and out cables, as well.
