			Recently I started GMing a Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader TTRPG campaign for two of my friends. Since starting, I have made quite a few things for the game
			beyond the normal GM work: a heraldic achievement for the players' Rogue Trader Dynasty; an SVG version of the very low-res map in the book; and "character"
			sheets for NPCs, vehicles, and starships. The main focus of this post, however, is my newest project: A database for keeping track of all the charts of
			warp routes the players	have and a website interface allowing for easy retrieval of the information in those charts.

			At first, the idea was much smaller, I was going to learn how to use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/base/">LibreOffice Base</a>, LibreOffice's
			desktop database front end, and use it's built-in HSQL database. I did use it to enter all the warp routes, but the methods for looking at the data weren't
			really great in this use case as far as I could tell. So, I exported the database to a CSV and copied it onto the server, where I made a new
			<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database. Finally I copied all the data into the new database via the COPY command, and got to work
			building a custom front end. I am using Vite and Vue for the website front end, since they work well and I'm familiar with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The front end, at its most basic, needs to fulfill two roles: viewing existing charts and adding new ones. To start with, I have focused on viewing them, as
			it's the more important of the two. Currently, there is a form with two inputs: one for starting location and one for ending location. When neither one is filled,
			both will provide suggestions from all locations in the database, retrieved when the site loads. If one of the inputs has something in it, when the other is
			focused it will retrieve and suggest connections either to or from the location in the other input, depending on whether it is the start or end input. The direction
			matters because warp routes are uni-directional	so the route from A to B is separate from the B to A route. When the "Get Charts" button is pressed the server
			will return charts based on what data was provided. If no start or end were specified, all charts are returned; if just the start or end were provided, any
			connections to that start or endpoint are returned; if both the start and end are provided, that chart is returned.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, I figured out how to implement an animated glitchy filter over the top of everything, like it's being viewed on an old dataslate. I might add more
			effects	as I figure them out, but getting it to this point took quite a while. To place an SVG filter, you should only have to define it in an SVG file, and
			point the CSS to it, but, unfortunately that didn't work, presumably due to Vite or Vue. Instead, I eventually found a way to place the filter inline in the
			CSS in <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/svgs-filters-can-be-inlined-in-css/">this blog</a>. Further animating it wasn't too difficult, as
			there is a way to do that with native SVG using the "animate" tag. Currently the glitchy filter uses turbulence generated almost all on the x-axis to displace
			a line of pixels a bit with the turbulence's baseFrequency being animated really slowly.
