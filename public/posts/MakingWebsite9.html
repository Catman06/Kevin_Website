			I'm finally getting around to doing something that I have been meaning to do for a while now: fixing the method by which posts are gotten for the blog.
			Currently, when the page loads every post is downloaded from the server and placed into Session Storage. This is slow and wildly inefficient, as all
			posts are retrieved instead of just the ones being viewed. Additionally, the download happens even if just the post list is being displayed. So to
			improve load times and reduce how much data has to be sent from the server, I am changing how the blog gets it's posts.
		</p>
		<p>
			First off, I'm separating getting the post's main content from the stuff shown in the previews by adding a PHP file for getting just the meta fields of
			a	post. I was initially going to just retrieve the meta info from all posts, but in order to facilitate future improvements to the post preview, namely
			adding paging, I want to be able to retrieve each post's info independently.
		</p>
		<p>
			For caching the fetch requests, I was initially going to use (and partially implemented) a service worker; Then I realized that it would be far easier
			and more effective to just let the browser handle caching. Now, everything is gotten via fetches every time, which is far simpler than before and
			allows for each post's data to be downloaded separately rather than all the posts being downloaded at the same time when the page loads. That means that
			the website should start displaying post previews far faster than before.
