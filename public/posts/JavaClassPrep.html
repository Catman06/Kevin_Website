			As I am about to start a college course on basic Java, I thought it might be a good idea to quickly re-familiarize myself with the
			language. I have used some Java before when I did FIRST Robotics, but that was quite a while ago, and aside from recently contributing
			a small <a href="https://github.com/DragonsPlusMinecraft/CreateEnchantmentIndustry/pull/288">pull request</a> for a Minecraft mod, I
			haven't used Java in a long time. While I suppose the point of this class is to teach the basics of Java, so preemptively learning the
			language is redundant, I just picked up the book for the course - <i>Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures</i> and
			couldn't help trying some of the 'Programming Exercises' for fun.
		</p>

			Of course the first step was setting up a development environment. While I did download Eclipse, I actually ended up using VS Code to do
			everything due to being more familiar with it. Also Eclipse's dark mode looks pretty bad, and in Code, I have a custom dark green theme
			already set up. To get Code ready for Java development, I finally decided to make use of the 'profiles' feature that allows for different
			sets of settings, and extensions to be used. Previously I didn't bother and just had extensions for anything and everything active at once.
			However that was getting annoying, and so I have now created profiles for both Java and Web Development, and plan to set up ones for Godot,
			Rust, C++, and Raspberry Pi Pico.
		</p>

			Once I had Code set up for Java, I started doing some exercises. Unsurprisingly, the exercises at the start of the book were easy, but did
			remind me of how Java works. After getting bored with the easy ones, I moved on to trying out some JavaFX stuff. The book doesn't go over
			getting and setting up JavaFX itself, so I followed the guide on the <a href="https://openjfx.io">JavaFX site</a>. After getting it working
			I didn't do too much with it, as I don't want to have done <i>too</i> much before the class.
