			I'm finally making the switch over to Linux. While I've used it for a long time on my server, that is a very different
			side of Linux than Desktop Linux. Still, that experience has made switching a far more comfortable experience than
			it might otherwise have been. In addition, I have switched several other computers to Linux before, though they are
			being used by people who are decidedly not power-users.
		</p>
		<p>
			While for my sister and mom I decided on Mint and OpenSUSE respectively, for myself I wanted something I was more familiar
			with configuring and working with. Since my server runs Arch Linux, I have quite a bit of experience working with Arch, and
			so I wanted my new Desktop OS to be Arch based. Ultimately, I settled on <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a>, a distro
			that is designed for performance and is built on Arch Linux. It provides optimized packages from their own repos and an
			optimized kernel for extra performance. It also has an installer, which makes the initial setup way faster, as even though
			I've done it plenty of times, installing Arch without an installer still takes me a while.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once I had chosen a distro, I had to decide how to partition my disks. While I could have really cut down on what's on my Windows
			M.2 drive, split the drive, and set up proper dual-booting, that would have been severely reduced available space, risked something
			happening to the EFI partition and making one of the OSes unbootable, and been annoying to set up. Instead, seeing as my motherboard
			has 2 M.2 slots, I bought a second drive to put Linux on, and left switching OSes as something to do by manually changing the
			boot order when I want to change OSes. I'm not planning on going back to Windows very often, so I don't really mind. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After finally installing CachyOS to the new drive, I got to setting it up to my liking. I chose KDE Plasma for the desktop
			environment, as it provides the best mix of customization and features in my opinion. Next was setting up the command line
			environment as I like it, with my aliases and tools. Fortunately on that front I could use a script I had previously written
			to do all that setup for me. It gets <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> and <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>
			setup to my liking, and all I had to do was install and move over the config for <a href="https://wezterm.org/">WezTerm</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far I hadn't done anything I hadn't done before, between the server, VMs, and WSL installs, I had setup Arch commandlines
			plenty, and Plasma is pretty straightforward to setup. Next, however, was games. Gaming on Linux has gotten FAR better in
			the past few years, expecially since the Steam Deck came out and Valve started Proton, their fork of Wine, but most games don't
			have a native Linux version, and Proton/Wine, while providing functionality for most games, isn't perfect.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first issue I ran into with running games was that they seem to default to using my weak GPU. I have 2 GPUs in my computer, with
			the relatively beefy NVIDIA card running my main monitor, and an old AMD card running the 2 side monitors. To get games to use
			the correct GPU, I eventually found that the setting DRI_PRIME to the right card in Launch Options would force the game to use
			the right card. While it's somewhat annoying to have to set a launch option for every game, I only have to do it once per game.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ran into my next issue when trying to get my HOTAS setup to work with MechWarrior 5. It was constantly seeing all axis as
			being moved a significant distance from center. This was made worse by the games poor method of changing joystick settings where
			you alter a text file and restart the game. The only changes that can be done in-game are setting buttons axis. You have to fully
			restart the game everytime you want to change a deadzone or offset for an axis. I'm not really sure if it's a Linux issue however,
			as issues with setting up joysticks for MW5 seems to be a pretty universal issue. Additionally, the same setup worked flawlessly
			in Project Wingman (which also uses Proton), so I think the issue is the game, not the OS or compatability layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, as long as I've had Linux on this computer there's been another issue. When the computer wakes from sleep, there is a
			decent chance that the 2 side monitors, the ones on the old AMD card, will be completely unusable. They show a mess of the right
			colors all glitchly smeared across the display. I can fix the issue by changing the resolution to something else and then back,
			so it's not a showstopping issue, but it is quite annoying. So far I can't find any reason for the issue or anyone else with the
			same issue, and even attempts to just automatically resize the screens every time the computer wakes haven't worked out. I'm
			kind of at a loss as to where to go from here. I somewhat suspect a driver issue, as it's both monitors on the card, and not the
			monitor on the other, however I have yet to discover the cause.
