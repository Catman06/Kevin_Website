            After getting the Aptiva working, I felt the desire to do more with
            old computers. Looking around, I saw an old Dell tower that I was
            basically using as a bucket of old computer parts (I know it's not
            great to do that, but most of these weren't expected to ever be used
            again). I took a closer look at it and discovered that there were a
            few bulging capacitors, which wasn't too suprising, seeing as this
            computer is ~20 years old. At firse I thought that these capacitors
            were
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague"
                >plagued</a
            >, but after further research the computer came out just after the
            main years of the plague, so I'm not certain either way. Regardless,
            the solution remains the same: replace all the types of capacitors
            that have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process for recapping a motherboard is simple, first record
            where all the capacitors are and what they are. Fortunately Dell has
            identifiers for each capacitor silkscreened onto the board so I can
            just record that along with the capacitance and voltage. Next step
            is to find all the capacitors to be replaced. While I think you
            technically should replace all of the capacitors on the board, I
            decided to just go with the ones that had failed and ones that were
            of reportedly bad series.
        </p>
        <p>
            After identifying the capacitors I wanted to replace I went to
            DigiKey to buy their replacements. I just found capacitors that were
            the same size, same voltage, same capacitance, and the best lifetime
            at at least the same temperature and ordered them. In order to do
            work on the motherboard, my current absolute bare-minimum soldering
            iron wouldn't do, so I also purchaced a slightly better than minumum
            soldering iron as well as a solder sucker. The new iron supported
            setting a temperature and had several interchangable tips, including
            a smaller one, which I needed to accurately desolder and solder the
            close together components on the motherboard more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the new iron arrived, I set about desoldering all the replaced
            capacitors. While most went smoothly, some of the larger ones had
            massive areas of copper surrounding the hole, I think, which make
            heating the solder incredibly difficult. Ultimately, those solder I
            never really managed to fully get all of the solder out of the holes
            and just had to deal with that later.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the old components out of the board, and the new capacitors
            ready to go in, I sat down to finish up the board. Similarly to when
            desoldering, most of the capacitors got soldered in without issue,
            but the large ones were hard to heat sufficiently and they still had
            solder clogging the hole. In order to get them in I just had to
            crank the iron very hot and melt the solder as I inserted the
            component. It didn't work well, but it did work, so despite the
            joints being quite poor, the capacitors were in place.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was then time to actually test the board. I got the monitor and
            keyboard hooked up plugged it in and turned it on and it started
            giving a beep code. It did power on and nothing popped, so mostly a
            success for the recap it seemed. I looked up what the code meant,
            and it turned out to be an issue with memory. I had replaced a
            capacitor nearby the DIMM slots, so I was worried that something
            went wrong with that. I tried removing some memory to see if it was
            the memory that was bad, and the computer POSTed without issue.
            Relieved that I hadn't screwed anything up, I took the computer and
            set it up fully with what I believe is its original HDD. Just to
            make sure that the memory I had removed was really bad, I placed it
            back in and powered on and the computer POSTed just fine, so it
            apparently just needed to be re-seated or something.
        </p>

            Now that all the hardware was working, I wanted to get Windows XP
            back onto the computer, as that is what it would have shipped with.
            In fact it still had the XP badge and certificate of authenticity
            with the key for XP Home on it. Installation went smoothly, with me
            burning the XP Home installer onto a CD and then booting it. After
            installation I needed to find the necessary drivers for everything.
            Fortunately Dell still has all of the drivers and updates to drivers
            still available on their website, so I just downloaded all of them,
            stuck them on a flash drive and installed the ones that were needed
            for the Dell Dimension 4700. In addition to drivers, I upgraded
            Windows XP up to Service Pack 3.
