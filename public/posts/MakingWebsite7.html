			After making the posts transition, I wanted to make the post previews do the same. I had to use a TransitionGroup component as the post previews are
			a v-for directive. TransitionGroups are used for applying transitions to all members of a v-for so I couldn't just move the whole group at once, but
			the the only real difference in implementation between the previews and the post was how far the previews needed to be set to move. Due to the previews
			all moving to the same point, rather than staying in position relative to one another, the previews were set to leave the screen just enough to hide
			them. If the previews were set to leave to a point too far offscreen, the previews would move too fast, if the point is too close, the preview would
			disappear onscreen.

			With transitions set up, I felt that the website was basically functional and decided to set this as version 1.0.0. We'll see how good I am at
			incrementing the version as I add and change things. I will try to vaguely follow semantic versioning practices as much as makes sense for a website
			as opposed to a library. The reason I decided to use versioning at all was simply because I wanted something to fill in the 'version' field in
			package.json, so no great cause for alarm if I don't keep it updated.
