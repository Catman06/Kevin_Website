			Today I finished getting my prototype circuit working. I was having issues getting the TRIAC to open, and discovered (eventually) that
			I had connected the gate pin to the wrong side of the TRIAC, meaning that no current would flow to it, even if the optocoupler was active.
			After reconnecting the gate pin correctly, I was able to pulse my test load (an old bench grinder). However, doing this brought to light
			an issue that I totally should have considered before: heat.
		</p>
		<p>
			TRIACs, it turns out, produce a lot of heat when switching mains current, which makes sense, that's a lot of power going through, but it
			just hadn't occurred to me to figure out how much heat would be generated. Turns out, if I use a single TRIAC with 10 amps going through it
			and disregarding the fact that it will stop working at 125°C, the TRIAC would end up at 675°C over the ambient temperature. So I needed to
			make that not happen.
		</p>
		<p>
			First off, I decided to use multiple TRIACs, this would divide the current flowing between them greatly reducing temperatures. To figure out
			how many I would need, I needed to calculate the heat generated by the TRIAC in operation, <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/679307">this StackExchange post</a> 
			was extremely useful in that regard, providing the formulas and importantly, showing which symbols mean what in a datasheet. This is what I used
			to figure out that the single TRIAC would heat up by 675°C. However, I also wanted to use heatsinks on the TRIACs to further push down their
			temperature. To figure the temperature of the TRIAC I used the heatsinks datasheet, which includes the relationship between the distance
			from ambient temperature and the number of watts dissipated by the heatsink, to subtract from the number of watts generated by the TRIAC at
			any given amperage. I then solved the resulting system of equations to get a formula giving the resulting watts generated by the TRIAC minus
			the amount dissipated by the heatsink.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the above method I determined a good number of TRIACs is 4, where the temperature should only rise 42.2°C (with heatsinks) and the
			amperage going to each TRIAC's gate <i>should</i> be enough to trigger them. If not, 3 TRIACs will still have the temperature rising only
			56.3°C. Of course that's all assuming that I did good math and the numbers I got out are vaguely correct, which I am not confident about.
			Once I get the additional components I'll find out whether I succeeded or if the circuit will break.
