			I have finally decided to rip out the frankly very stupid method of sizing the logo in the navbar that I was using. What was being done involved a JavaScript function
			running anytime the page was resized and updating css variables for the size of the logo to be the same as the height of the navbar. This wasn't great,
			as it would flash the logo at full size on loading the page, and the logo would lag behind when scaling the page. It couldn't have been efficient either.
			The main issue I had before is that I couldn't figure out how to have the text in the links be vertically centered while also having the navbar use a
			specific height. The navbar needs to be a specific height, and not defined by it's contents, because the image must be given a height that is relative
			to that of the navbar. If it was just those two elements, everything would be easy, but there are also the links. The links don't scale evenly with em,
			meaning that at larger or smaller sizes the text in the links would stray from being vertically centered.

			I arrived at the previous solution by looking at the site for Vite and seeing that their logo's size was determined by a variable. I assumed that variable
			was being defined in JavaScript and so began trying to implement that myself. In the end, it took quite a lot of work figuring out how to interact with
			CSS rules from JavaScript and ended up not working great anyway. Since I had spent so long making it work I hadn't touched it for a while, however today
			I looked at the built site and noticed the JavaScript wasn't working, I managed to fix the issue with finding the right stylesheet, but felt that the whole
			concept was way too much for what I was trying to do so I set about finding a good way to scale the navbar in just CSS. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Ultimately, the solution I reached is very simple, make a variable to hold the desired height of the navbar, set the logo_holder and links to be 100% of that,
			and then set the links' line-height to the navbar's height. I honestly don't know why I didn't come up with something like this initially! It's much easier
			than using JavaScript to change variables, and far more effective as well.
