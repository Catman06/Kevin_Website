			This morning I performed a bunch of fixes and small improvements. The most significant of these was setting up the resume page. It's a very simple page that just
			consists of an &lt;object&gt; holding the PDF of my resume. The most interesting thing I did with it was implement an eventListener that updates the height of the
			object based on the window's height. Other fixes include the logo, which was trying to set the variable for navbar_height on the wrong stylesheet, adding	in
			messages for if javascript is disabled on a browser, and making it so the buttons for seeing more previews in BlogApp will only show up if there are more posts
			in that direction. Unfortunately none of these fixes and additions were particularly interesting, but it's good that they're done.
