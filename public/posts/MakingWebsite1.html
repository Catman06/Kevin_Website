			My previous website was primarily designed for the purpose of making a website.
			As such, it has ended up mostly as center for going to other projects, which was
			fine, but now I feel that having a record of what projects I'm doing could be helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
			This new website is being made with the Vue framework, which I have previously used for
			a grocery database front-end. However, I didn't remember a ton, and am using it in a
			fairly different manner and have needed to relearn quite a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main place Vue is being used is in the blog previews and blog post display.
			These need lots of dynamically created instances on the part of the blog previews, and
			significant modularity on the part of the actual blog display.
			These have been created as .vue Single File Components that allow for each to have their
			own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in them. Both the blog display and previews are made up of
			two parts: a holder and the post. The holder is there to handle the logic of passing posts
			to the post display/preview components and the post components provide a regular format for
			displaying the post.
		</p>
		<p>
			The posts themselves are each an individual HTML file with custom meta tags that provide a
			'Post' object with all it's needed data. Here is the base, unfilled HTML:
			<div class="code_container">
			<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta name="date" content="" /&gt;
		&lt;meta name="category" content="" /&gt;
		&lt;meta name="title" content="" /&gt;
		&lt;meta name="blurb" content="" /&gt;
		&lt;style&gt;
			
		&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
			</div>
			The HTML file can include both full HTML and CSS for display (Though no JavaScript).
			When loaded, the file is parsed into a Post object that holds all the meta tags as strings,
			the content as a DocumentFragment, and the style as a CSSStyleSheet.
			This does seem like a worse version of a .vue compontent, however, there are two reasons that
			this HTML method is what I went with. First off, I couldn't find a good way to have the file hold
			metadata about itself. Vue SFCs are generally meant to be receiving the data, not providing it to
			items higher up on the tree. Second, .vue SFCs need to be built. If I had used SFCs for the posts,
			I would have to rebuild the entire site every time I added a post, with would be a hassle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Getting the HTML files into JavaScript ended up being more difficult than I had expected.
			I needed to get a selection of files' URLs that I wouldn't know beforehand, as I wanted the
			post files to have meaningful names. Fortunately, Vite (the build tool I'm using for Vue) has
			a glob import feature that allows me to get an array of paths from a glob path.
			The paths are then each fetch-ed (creating some issues with having to have the function be async)
			and converted to HTMLDocuments which are then converted to Post objects.
