			I received and constructed the circuit with the new parts today. With that, there came some good and some bad. The good is that it works.
			I was able to successfully control the duty cycle of whatever is connected to the circuit with the dial. The bad is that only one TRIAC
			was operating.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason only one TRIAC functioned, as I found out, is that with not perfectly equal resistance between the TRIACs, the one with the lowest
			resistance in it's path will receive most of the current. I thought that it wouldn't be an issue because as stuff heats up they gain more
			resistance. However, that is not true for semiconductors; they <i>lower</i> their resistance when hot, meaning that the one TRIAC just gets
			more of the current as it heats up from the current already passing through.
		</p>
		<p>
			My new solution is perhaps what I should have done from the start: get a really big heat sink. The biggest one Digi-Key has for the TO-220 package
			(the package of the TRIACs I'm using). The new heatsink is rated for 20W at 60°C over ambient, whereas the one I have now are rated for something like 2.5W at
			the same difference. So hopefully that will be sufficient.
		</p>
		<p>
			In regards to my math last time, I'm fairly sure I got something wrong, as when I did the same calculations for this new heatsink, I got higher
			temperatures. So I don't know exactly how hot it will get with the new heat sink.
