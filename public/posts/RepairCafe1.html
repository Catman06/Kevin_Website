            Over the weekend I volunteered at the first Peoria Repair Cafe. It's
            an event that provides a space for volunteers with knowledge about
            repairing things to assist and teach people with things that need to
            be repaired. I, of course, volunteered to work with computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In preparation for the Cafe, I gathered whatever I thought might be
            useful. This included things that made sense, like a multimeter and
            a wide variety of screwdriver bits, up to far less likely to be used
            tools, like an old PSU.
        </p>

            When I arrived at the community center where the Repair Cafe was
            taking place I got set up at the computer repair table and started
            waiting for the event to start. As I waited for our first computer
            in need of repair I talked with the other person on computer repair,
            Ruben.

            Our first "repair" was helping a woman set up a few small devices
            with her phone. There was a portable thermal printer, a security
            camera, and some hearing aids. With the printer and security camera,
            it was a case of installing a sketchy app from the app store and
            connecting the device, and the hearing aids were a standalone
            device.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that we got our first actual repair: 2 CD changers. Were they
            computers? No. Should they have gone to the people doing small
            appliances? Maybe. But did we take on the job? Yes. Unfortunately,
            it was an unmitigated failure. We repaired neither of the changers,
            though we did successfully disassemble and reassemble them.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the first CD changer, we narrowed the issue to the playback
            motor, probably. It wasn't spinning at a steady speed, and so it
            while it could have been something else, it was the only thing I
            could think of it being in the moment. We did manage to find the
            part number, however due to it being a ~30 year old device we
            couldn't find a replacement.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I should have done is properly researched the device and the
            issues it was having. Instead I got caught up in what should have
            been a simple check for any visible damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the second CD changer, it was a similar situation, where we
            fully focused on disassembly and didn't do proper research on the
            problem. It's problem was less clear, it would pick up and spin a
            disc, but wouldn't play it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In both of these devices cases, It's probably unlikely that there
            would have been any fix we could have performed. If it was a blown
            capacitor, I had brought a box of capacitors, if something had
            become unsoldered, I had a soldering iron. Unfortunately, it
            probably was something like an issue with an IC, where there's
            simply nothing we could do.
        </p>

            I had signed up to do just the first shift from 9:00 to 11:00, but
            the person that was going to take the second shift was sick so I
            ended up going until the end at 12:30. Despite the poor showing in
            regards to fixing things, I did have a good time and will, assuming
            scheduling works, volunteer at the next one.
