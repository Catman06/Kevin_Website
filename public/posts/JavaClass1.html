			On the second, the Java class began, though no Java has yet been done. So far, the only assignment has been to introduce ourselves on Canvas, the online
			platform the class it using, and reply to two other introductions. An unnecessary and plainly cruel start to the class that has no reason for happening.
			Nobody gains from the exercise, the class is online anytime, so we won't be seeing each other (not that in person ice breakers are excusable).

			In terms things that are actually on topic, we are supposed to use Netbeans and Java 8. I'm not sure if we need to use the ancient version of Netbeans
			that the link points to or if the link just haven't been updated. For now I am using the latest version of Netbeans, which shouldn't matter as the only
			place that I think it even matters is in how projects are structured and exported as zip files. We are supposed to turn in assignments as zips of Netbeans
			projects. As far as I'm aware, the file structure hasn't changed, so I should be fine.

			I did have some issues with setting up Java 8 on top of Java 24. More specifically, I had trouble upgrading Java 22 to 24. It took me quite a while to figure
			out that the path to the JDK in the PATH has to be placed before the oracle ones if you want to manually install it. The actual installation of another JDK
			on top of the default one is as simple as placing it in <code>C:\Program Files\Java\</code> and selecting it in Netbeans as a new Java platform.
